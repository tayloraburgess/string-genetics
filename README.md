# Genetic String Evolution/Selection

This is a very basic script that mutates a random string over generations until it matches a given input string. Uses a fitness function to evaluate each string and then selects new generations based on the resulting fitness value.

- Built as a small practice project
- Currently uses the Hamming Distance to evaluate fitness, but this may change
- I’m no geneticist, so this may be a horribly crude/completely inaccurate model evolution/selection…but enjoyable to design nonetheless
